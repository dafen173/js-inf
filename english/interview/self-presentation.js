Hi! My name is Alexander. I live with my family in Kyiv.
And lately I'm doing my best to become a full fledged IT switcher in the direction of web development.
For more than 10 years I have been working in a company related to the distribution of audio video equipment.
About 4 years ago, I started learning front-end development.
I learned HTML and CSS using the HTML ACADEMY resource. Then I studied JS at FreeCodeCamp.
But I learned FrontEnd more fully in courses from Kottans. Kottans is a large and cool community of Ukrainian developers.
The course from them was very deep and detailed.
But to my regret, due to family circumstances and workload at the current job,
I could not get into their main course.
Fortunately, the course from Kottans could be taken in absentia, without time limits. And it suited me perfectly!
I went through almost all of this course.
But on the last module, I was distracted by an interesting test task for one of the vacancies.
By the way, that last module was about Typescript.. Yes... Now I am regreting that I digressed then...
So then there was another task, and then another one...
And then, around March 2022, there were practically no internships and vacancies for interns.



And just at that moment I found the RS-School with its impressive number of different courses!
I chose the JS course in order to structure and refresh my knowledge of basic technologies.
And I also hoped to get new useful skills and knowledge from this training. My expectations were one hundred percent realized.
I really like the well-thought-out structure of the RS App educational platform.
It is very convenient when everything is in one place: statistics, rating table, schedule, tests and more.
It is immediately clear that the system has been tested in practice for more than one year.
And the base of theoretical materials is just clear and cool!
And of course, the RS school's community, always ready to help, represented by organizers, mentors and students!
All of you have helped me a lot. Thank you very much!

So I really hope that I can be able to continue to enjoy this training.
Because in this course I fully experienced everything that I like in programming:
- for the most part, depend only on myself and my knowledge and skills
- immediately see the result of my work
- begin to understand how things work that were not clear to me before
  and then realize that everything is not so difficult actually
- And the most important thing! For a long time to think about solving some problem,
  and then finally solve it and catch this feeling! Feeling of satisfaction!

That's probably all for now.
Thank you for your attention!
All the best!
And I hope to see you again!


=====================================================================

поэтому я очень надеюсь, что смогу иметь возможность и дальше получать удовольствие от этого обучения
потому что на этом курсе я в полной мере испытал все что мне нравится в програмировании:
-   по большей мере, зависеть только от себя и своих знаний и умений
-   сразу видеть результат своей работы
-   понимать как работает то, что раньше для меня было как андроидный коллайдер
    и потом осозновать что все не так уж и сложно на самом деле
-   И самое главное! Долгое время думать о решении какойто задачи, а потом наконецто решить ее и словить это чувство!
    Чувство удовлетворенности!

Спасибо за внимание!
Всего Наилучшего!
И надеюсь, до новых встреч!
