And if all this were real
You would know it was true
It would actually feel
It would feel just like you

It would have a real voice
It would hear what you'd say
And with freedom of choice
It would choose its own way

Choose to then come alive
With a heart and a soul
And a will to survive
And a world to control

It would conquer the land
Find its own special star
It would be in command
It would travel so far

Far beyond all your fears
Where a ladder appears
Up the rungs it would climb
Leaving you far behind

It would answer the call
It would answer your prayer
But it's no one at all
And no one is there

No one to see
No one to show
No one to be
No one to know

There's no one to know
No one to know

Grab the goat by the horns
And go fold up the cross
Know the rose by its thorns
Take the world as a loss

It's a new golden dawn
And the flute of the fawn
Plays a deafening tone
I'm completely alone

No one to see
No one to show
No one to be
No one to know
