Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock and roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today

Pain
(Here comes the pain!)

[Verse 1]
Enemy, show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything even if I can't handle you
Readily, either way, it better be
Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
What the hell am I saying? I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off
Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Fuck it!

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leaving me suspect, I'm leaving you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
Go

[Bridge]
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you

[Outro]
Sick, sick, sick, sick
Yeah
