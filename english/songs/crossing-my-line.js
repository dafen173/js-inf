Hardcore, given in to me
I'm taking you out of your low-fi misery.
Fuck you you're a waiste a time
Crossing my line with your straight edge sanctity.

Drop the preaching dumb fuck
I'm above you
There is no need to sell your sanctuary round here yooo
Drop the preaching dumb fuck
I'm above you
There is no need to sell your sanctuary round here yooo

Weary head jelly legs ready for the undertake?
They're coming to take you away!
Sneaking up on your codex fake
They're coming to take you away!

Like the eenie like the meany
like the eenie meany mind blow
Way out of line it's time for your goodbye ho.
Like the eenie like the meany
