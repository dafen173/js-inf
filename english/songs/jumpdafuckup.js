Jump the fuck up
(Aaa)

Motherfucker you don't understand
All my hate
Motherfucker you don't understand
All my rage
Motherfucker you don't understand
All my pain
Motherfucker you don't understand

You seem to sever all my frequencies
I'm tethered to your energies
And everythin' turns inside out
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud
Maybe you would like to peek through the curtain
At the same mistake you know you always make
But all I really want to know is
Are you gonna lay the fuck back down
Or jump the fuck up

Walkin' in the streets and lookin' at all this shit
I'm full of hate don't fuck with me
Walkin' in the streets and lookin' at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fuckin' see
We got the tribe against society
We got to fight the real enemy
Get the fuck up stand the fuck up
Back the fuck uuup

Love is, is makin' things a bit insane
And I don't care who stares or stays
The only thing that matters ends
Will you reach out if you can't resist
Maybe you don't give a shit for the rest of us
But if you do the time is now if it ever was
If you're gonna fight whatcha gonna do
Jump the fuck up
(Oh, oh)

Motherfucker you don't understand
All my hate
Motherfucker you don't understand
All my rage
Motherfucker you don't understand
All my pain
Motherfucker you don't understand

How dare you single out my honesty?
Compare me to your travesties
I only want to see you fight
The darkness you wanna live your life by



And if you're gonna quit. 
I don't give a shit 
What the fuck, I'm a Mack truck. 
Are you gonna give up like a bitch. 
Or jump the fuck up?

Walking in the streets and looking at all this shit
I'm full of hate don't fuck with me,
Walking in the streets and looking at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fucking see
We got the tribe against society
We got to fight the real enemy
Get the fuck up stand the fuck up
Muthafucka.

I'm a self-destructive piece of shit
Smear me in.
I don't owe you a goddamn thing
This life has never had the swing.
I don't want to be immortal or legend or anything.
'cause the longer I'm alive the better off you'll be.
Get ready for epitome come on and pity me.
Will you kill me if I say please?

I'm the same old reasons not to try
What the hell.
Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell.
Come and get me
 mom would never let me do it
I'm ruined.
I don't want anything from you
'cause I've got nothing left to prove, common hay!
My time everything feels fine
goodbye.
Killing from the inside!
