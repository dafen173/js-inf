My name is Alexander. I live with my family in Kyiv.
And lately I’m doing my best to become a full fledged IT switcher in the direction of web development.
About 4 years ago, I started learning front-end development.
I learned HTML and CSS using the HTML ACADEMY resource. Then I studied JS at FreeCodeCamp.
But I learned FrontEnd more fully in courses from Kottans.
Kottans is a large community of Ukrainian developers. The course from them was not limited by time
frames
and I went through almost all of this course. But on the last module,
I was distracted by an interesting test task for one of the vacancies.
And then there was another task, and then another one… And then, around March 2022,
there were practically no internships and vacancies for interns.

And just at that moment I found the RS-School with its large number of different courses!
I chose the JS course in order to structure and refresh my knowledge of basic technologies.
And I also hoped to get new useful skills and knowledge from this training.
My expectations were one hundred percent realized.




We still have a difficult situation with electricity. We have power cuts from 4 to 8 hours in one day.
And of course, the missile attacks continue,
this attacks knocks out the working rhythm even more than a power outage.
