/*


Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism
that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, or port), other than its own,
and for these origins a browser should permit loading resources.

CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request
to the server hosting the cross-origin resource,
in order to check that the server will permit the actual request.
