/*

Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:


let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;


Interpolation
Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.

The method is called string interpolation.


let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;
