The Catalog of Design Patterns

Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
Factory Method

Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance.
Real-World Analogy
The government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern.
A country can have only one official government.



Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Proxy
The Proxy Pattern offers a placeholder object, instead of the actual object. The placeholder object will have control over the access to the actual object value.
Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
A credit card is a proxy for a bank account, which is a proxy for a bundle of cash. Both implement the same interface: they can be used for making a payment. A consumer feels great because there’s no need to carry loads of cash around.


Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
Chain of Responsibility

Observer
The Observer Pattern is one of the most widely used patterns of all.
It has a unique implementation across platforms like Angular, and React.
This pattern creates a subscription model. Objects can subscribe to specific events.
And, when the event happens, they will be notified.
Much of JS concepts depend on the Observer Pattern.
---------
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to
notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
Real-World Analogy: Magazine and newspaper subscriptions.
