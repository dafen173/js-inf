A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a programâ€™s execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments.

Also, a pure function does not produce any observable side effects such as network requests or data mutation, etc.

Emample:

function calculateGST( productPrice ) {
    return productPrice * 0.05;
}
console.log(calculateGST(15))
