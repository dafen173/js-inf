HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses

Clients are often browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari), but they can be any type of program or device.

Servers are most often computers in the cloud.


HTTP Request / Response
Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
A web server receives the request
The server runs an application to process the request
The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
The client (the browser) receives the response
The HTTP Request Circle
A typical HTTP request / response circle:

The browser requests an HTML page. The server returns an HTML file.
The browser requests a style sheet. The server returns a CSS file.
The browser requests an JPG image. The server returns a JPG file.
The browser requests JavaScript code. The server returns a JS file
The browser requests data. The server returns data (in XML or JSON).


All browsers have a built-in XMLHttpRequest Object (XHR).
XHR is a JavaScript object that is used to transfer data between a web browser and a web server.
XHR is often used to request and receive data for the purpose of modifying a web page.

The XHR Object is a Web Developers Dream, because you can:

Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background
